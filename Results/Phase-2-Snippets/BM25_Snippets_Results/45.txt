Multi-attribute Retrieval with Combined Indexes
In this paper a file organization scheme designed toreplace the use of the popular SECONDARY INDEX filing scheme ( or inverted files on SECONDARY key fields ) is described Through the use of redundancy and storing keys ( or access numbers of the records ) that satisfy different combinationsof SECONDARY INDEX values in `` buckets , '' it is possible to retrieveall keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset offields by a single access to an INDEX file , although each bucket maybe used for many combinations of values and a combination ofbuckets may be required for a given query The method which , in itsdegenerate case , becomes the conventional SECONDARY INDEX filingscheme works similarly but has the following advantages : ( 1 ) the eliminationof multiple accesses in many cases ; ( 2 ) the eliminationof false drops ; ( 3 ) the elimination of computer time to perform intersectionof key sets each qualified for one SECONDARY INDEX fieldonly ; and ( 4 ) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an indexfield appearing in a query has very few possible values Redundancy , in some cases , is the same as the SECONDARY indexing method file organization , SECONDARY INDEX files , inverted files , informationretrieval , data management , access method , SECONDARY keys , storage with buckets , rapid retrieval , balanced filing scheme , eliminationof false drops , combining indexes , query , multi-attribute retrieval Multi-attribute Retrieval with Combined Indexes
