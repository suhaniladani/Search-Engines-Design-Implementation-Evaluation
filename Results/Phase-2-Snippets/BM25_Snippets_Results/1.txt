A Unifying Approach to Scheduling
Various classes of scheduling algorithmsare defined and related to existing algorithms scheduling algorithms , scheduling models , priority , OPERATING systems , processor SHARING , implementation efficiency The abstract model providesa framework for implementing flexible schedulers in real OPERATING systems Acriterion for the implementation efficiency of an algorithm is developed and results in the definitionof time-invariant algorithms , WHICH include most of the commonly implemented ones For time-invariantalgorithms , the dependence of processing rates on priorities is derived
