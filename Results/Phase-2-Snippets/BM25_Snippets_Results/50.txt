A Case Study in Programming for Parallel-Processors
A Case Study IN Programming for Parallel-Processors Parallel-processor systems are multiprocessor systems IN which several ofthe PROCESSORS can simultaneously execute separate tasks of a single job , thus cooperating to decreasethe solution time of a computational problem The PROCESSORS have independent instruction counters , meaningthat each processor executes its own task program relatively independently of the other PROCESSORS Communicationbetween cooperating PROCESSORS is by means of data IN storage shared by all PROCESSORS It is shown that , with proper programming , solution time when N PROCESSORS are applied approaches1/N times the solution time for a single processor , while improper programming can actually lead to an increaseof solution time with the number of PROCESSORS An affirmative partial answer is provided tothe question of whether it is possible to program parallel-processor computing systems to efficiently decreaseexecution time for useful problems Aprogram for the determination of the distribution of current IN an electrical network was written for aparallel-processor computing system , and execution of this program was simulated parallel-processor , parallelism , PARALLEL programming , multiprocessor , multiprogramming , tasking , storage interference , electrical network , simulation , relaxation , Jacobi , Gauss-Seidel , convergence

Interference Between Communicating Parallel Processes
Interference Between Communicating PARALLEL Processes Various kinds of interference between communicatingparallel processes have been examined by Dijkstra , Knuth , and others Solutions have been givenfor the mutual exclusion problem and associated subproblems , IN the form of PARALLEL programs , and informalproofs of correctness have been given for these solutions IN this paper a system of parallelprocesses is regarded as a machine which proceeds from one state S ( i concurrent programming control , cooperating processes , formal programs , interference , mutual exclusion , operating systems , PARALLEL processes

Syntax-Directed Interpretation of Classes of Pictures
A descriptive scheme for classes of pictures basedon labeling techniques using PARALLEL processing algorithms was proposed by the author some years ago The PARALLEL processingsimulator , originally written for an IBM 7094system , has now been rewritten for a CDC 3600 system A partial generative grammar for '' handwritten '' English letters is given , as are also a few computer-generated outputs using this grammarand the PARALLEL processing simulator mentioned earlier
