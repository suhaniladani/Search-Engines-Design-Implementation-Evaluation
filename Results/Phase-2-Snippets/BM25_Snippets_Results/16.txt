Distributed Processes: A Concurrent Programming Concept
Distributed PROCESSES : A Concurrent Programming Concept A language concept for concurrent processeswithout common variables is introduced These PROCESSES communicate and synchronize by means of procedurecalls and guarded regions The paper gives several examples of distributed processesand shows that they include procedures , coroutines , classes , monitors , PROCESSES , semaphores , buffers , pathexpressions , and input/output as special cases Concurrent programming , distributed PROCESSES , microprocessor networks , nondeterminism , guarded regions , programming languages , process communicationand scheduling , sorting arrays , coroutines , classes , monitors , PROCESSES , semaphores , buffers , path expressions , input/output

Solution of a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control
A number of mainly independent sequential-cyclicprocesses with restricted means of communication with each other can be made in such a way that at anymoment one and only one of them is engaged in the `` critical section '' of its cycle

An Overview of the ISPL Computer System Design
This paper explores the advantages of the concurrentdesign of the language , OPERATING system , and machine ( via microcode ) to create an interactive programminglaboratory It also suggested an importantnew concept for OPERATING SYSTEMS : separation of the scheduling from the maintenance functions in resourceallocation concurrent design , operating-system , scheduling , interprogram communication , incremental compilation , virtual addressing , debugging , hierarchical subsystems This freedom simplified both incremental compilation and the system 's addressing structure , and centralized thecommunication mechanisms enabling the construction of hierarchical subsystems
