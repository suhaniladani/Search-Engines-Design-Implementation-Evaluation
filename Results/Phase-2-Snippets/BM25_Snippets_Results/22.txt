Scan Conversion Algorithms for a Cell Organized Raster Display
Raster scan computer GRAPHICS with `` real time '' character generators have previously been limited to alphanumeric characters A display has been describedwhich extends the capabilities of THIS organization to include general GRAPHICS GRAPHICS , scan conversion , raster display , linedrawing , discrete image , dot generation , matrixdisplays Scan Conversion ALGORITHMS for a Cell Organized Raster Display Two fundamentally differentscan conversion ALGORITHMS which have been developed to support THIS display are presented The algorithmswere implemented in Fortran on the CDC 6400 computer Results obtained from the implementations showthat the noninteractive ALGORITHMS can significantly reduce display file storage requirements at little costin execution time over that of a conventional raster display
