An Information Algebra - Phase I Report-LanguageStructure Group of the CODASYL Development Committee
Thereport is BASED , for THE most part , on a mathematical model called `` An INFORMATION Algebra '' developed primarilyby R An INFORMATION Algebra - Phase I Report-LanguageStructure Group OF THE CODASYL Development Committee THE goal OF this work is to arrive at a properstructure for a machine-independent problem-defining language , at THE SYSTEMS level OF data processing It is hoped that this report will be read ( a ) with avid interest by programming languagedesigners and implementors , and all those interested IN developing a theoretical approach to dataprocessing ; ( b ) with interest and understanding by professional programmers and SYSTEMS analysts ; and ( c ) with appreciation by THE businessman-analyst-manager Rather , they have tried to present a philosophy to THE professional people who are vitallyconcerned with providing a working language for THE SYSTEMS analyst 's use

Solution of Systems of Polynomial Equations By Elimination
Solution OF SYSTEMS OF Polynomial Equations By Elimination THE elimination procedure as described by Williamshas been coded IN LISP and FORMAC and used IN solving SYSTEMS OF polynomial equations It is foundthat THE method is very effective IN THE case OF small SYSTEMS , where it yields all solutions withoutthe need for initial estimates THE method , by itself , appears IN appropriate , however , IN THE solutionof large SYSTEMS OF equation due to THE explosive growth IN THE intermediate equations and THE hazardswhich arise when THE coefficients are truncated
