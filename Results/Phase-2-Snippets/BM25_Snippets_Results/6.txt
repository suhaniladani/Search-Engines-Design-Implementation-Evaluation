Hierarchical Geometric Models for Visible Surface Algorithms
The GEOMETRIC structure inherent in the definitionof the shapes of three-dimensional objects and environments is used NOT just to define their relativemotion and placement , but also to assist in solving many other problems of systems for producingpictures by computer Hierarchical GEOMETRIC Models for Visible Surface Algorithms By using an extension of traditional structure information , or a GEOMETRIC hierarchy , five significant improvements to current techniques are possible Finally , the GEOMETRIC structure suggests a recursive descent , visible surface algorithm in which the computation time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene visible surface algorithms , hidden surface algorithms , hierarchical data structures , GEOMETRIC models
