Operating System Performance
OPERATING System Performance An overview of the current and future positionswith respect to OPERATING system performance is given Because of thesevere interactions between the various subsystems of an OPERATING system , an overall model of the totalsystem must be developed to be able to analyze and design the performance aspects of an OPERATING systemalthough such total system designs are exceptional today , it is projected that they will become increasinglymore common and necessary IN the near future Such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impacton the way we go about modularizing OPERATING and computer SYSTEMS computer system , OPERATING system , performanceevaluation , performance measurement , measurement , techniques , modularity , layering , structured programming , paging , virtual memory , input/output , disk storage facility , drum storage facility , sector queueing While a great deal of information and a largenumber of models FOR subsystems have been developed , gaps still exist IN out knowledge

The Organization of Structured Files
IN many SYSTEMS , the selection of an organization FOR the data within the file canbe critical to the system 's OPERATING efficiency This paper provides the SYSTEMS designer with an informationsource which describes ten techniques that may be employed FOR organizing structured data
