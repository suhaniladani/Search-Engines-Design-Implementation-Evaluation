The Teachable Language Comprehender: A Simulation Program and Theory of Language
The Teachable Language Comprehender ( TLC ) isa program designed to be capable of being taught to `` comprehend '' English TEXT When TEXT which the programhas not seen before IS input to it , it comprehends that TEXT by correctly relating each ( explicit or implicit ) assertion of the new TEXT to a large memory The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which havebeen found to relate to the new TEXT , adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of thenew TEXT By this means , the meaning of all TEXT the program successfully comprehends IS encoded intothe same format as that of the memory Both factualassertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating TEXT to the memory 's prior contentare to be taught to the program as they are needed Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language , andit provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehendtext of any particular kind The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertionsand capabilities for relating TEXT to such stored assertions to generalize automatically Thus the addition of a single factual assertion orlinguistic capability will often provide a large increment in TLC 's effective knowledge of the world andin its overall ability to comprehend TEXT TLC presently contains a relatively small number ofexamples of such assertions and capabilities , but within the system , notations for expressing either of theseare provided
