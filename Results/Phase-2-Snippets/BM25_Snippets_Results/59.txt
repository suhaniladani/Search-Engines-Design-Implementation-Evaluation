Do It by the Numbers-Digital Shorthand
Provision is made for transmission of purely numeric and/or binary streams , and for singlecharacter-transmission of non-dictionary WORDS such as the names of people or places Since ENGLISH WORDS form onlya sparse set of all possible alphabetic combinations , present methods are inefficient when computer systemsare substituted for these terminals Using numeric representations of entire WORDS or common phrases ( ratherthan character-by-character representations ) requires approximately one-third of present transmissiontime

In this paper a description is given of a modelprogramming system which is directed by a programming language and has a library for storing the user 's ITEMS Rules are given for transforming programs written in the language and for rearranging the ITEMS in thelibrary so that they share their common parts Some speculations are made about how the mechanicaldetection of common parts or patterns of library ITEMS could help a user to solve his problems , and aboutthe relationships between the behavior of the reprogramming machine and human intelligent behavior

A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing
A Vector Space Model for Automatic INDEXING In a document retrieval , or other pattern matchingenvironment where stored entities ( documents ) are compared with each other or with incoming patterns ( search requests ) , it appears that the best INDEXING ( property ) space is one where each entity lies as far awayfrom the others as possible ; in these circumstances the value of an INDEXING system may be expressibleas a function of the density of the object space ; in particular , retrieval performance may correlate inverselywith space density An approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimumindexing vocabulary for a collection of documents automatic information retrieval , automaticindexing , content analysis , document space
