Synchronizing Processors with Memory-Content-Generated Interrupts
Synchronizing Processors with Memory-Content-Generated Interrupts Implementations OF the `` Lock-Unlock '' methodof synchronizing processors in a multiprocessor system usually require uninterruptable , memory-pause type instructions An interlock scheme called read-interlock , which does not require memory-pause instructions , hasbeen developed for a dual DEC PDP-10 system with real-time requirements The read-interlock method doesrequire a special '' read-interlock '' instruction in the repertoire OF the processors and a special `` read-interlock '' cycle in the repertoire OF the MEMORY modules When a processor examines a `` lock '' ( a memorylocation ) with a read-interlock instruction , it will be interrupted if the lock was already set ; examininga lock immediately sets it if it was not already set ( this event sequence is a read-interlock cycle )
