On the External Storage Fragmentation Producedby First-Fit and Best-Fit Allocation Strategies
Through simulation , a series of experiments were performed in order to obtain better data on the relative PERFORMANCE offirst-fit AND best-fit AND a better understanding of the reasons underlying observed differences Results of simulation experiments supported this hypothesis AND showed that the relativeperformance of first-fit AND best-fit depends on the frequency of request

Computational Algorithms for Closed QueueingNetworks with Exponential Servers
Implementation considerationssuch as storage allocation strategies AND order of EVALUATION are examined in some detail The computational algorithms are based on two-dimensionaliterative TECHNIQUES which are highly efficient AND quite simple to implement

Considerations in the Design of a MultipleComputer System with Extended Core Storage
The use of large quantities of addressable ( but not executable ) fast random access memory to heighten the multiprogramming PERFORMANCE of a multicomputer systemis discussed Considerations in the Design of a MultipleComputer System with Extended Core Storage In the generalization of such a design , special emphasis isplaced on estimating expected gains when compared with the traditional configuration of separate AND independentcomputers without extended core storage multiple COMPUTER systems , extended core storage , multiprogrammed operating systems , multiprocessor operating systems , control data corporation 6600 , operating system with ECS

The Synthesis of Loop Predicates
Two classesof TECHNIQUES are considered : ( 1 ) heuristic methods which derive loop predicates from boundary conditionsand/or partially specified inductive assertions : ( 2 ) extraction methods which use input predicates andappropriate weak interpretations to obtain certain classes of loop predicates by an EVALUATION on the weak interpretation This paper discusses TECHNIQUES for mechanically synthesizing loop predicates
