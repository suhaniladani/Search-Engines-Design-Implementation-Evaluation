Synchronization of Communicating Processes
Formalization of a well-defined synchronizationmechanism can be used to prove that concurrently running processes of a system COMMUNICATE correctly This is demonstrated for a system consisting of many sending processes which deposit messages in a bufferand many receiving processes which remove messages from that buffer The formal description of the synchronizationmechanism makes it very easy to prove that the buffer will neither overflow nor underflow , that senders and receivers will never operate on the same MESSAGE frame in the buffer nor will they run into a deadlock parallel programming , multiprogramming , program CORRECTNESS , process communication , process scheduling

Space/Time Trade-offs in Hash Coding with Allowable Errors
In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factorsa given set of messages The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area ( space ) , the time required to identify a MESSAGE as a nonmember of the given set ( reject time ) , and an allowable error frequency Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowinga small number of test messages to be falsely identified asmembers of the given set will permit a much smaller hasharea to be used without increasing reject time An example is discussedwhich illustrates possible AREAS of application for the newmethods
