Multi-Tape and Infinite-State Automata -- A Survey
Multi-Tape and Infinite-State Automata -- A Survey A survey of machines which are more powerfulthan FINITE automata and less powerful than general Turing machines is presented It is felt that the machinesin this category are as closely related to digital computers as either the FINITE automata or theunrestricted Turing machines Intermediate machines can be created by adjoining on infinite-state memoryto a finite-state machine and then performing any or all of the following : ( 1 ) restrict the manner inwhich the unbounded portion of the memory can be accessed , ( 2 ) bound the number of steps allowed for acomputation by some increasing recursive function of the length of the input , ( 3 ) restrict the total amountof memory available in the same manner EXAMPLES from all three classes and their properties are discussed

Some Ideas on Data Types in High-Level Languages
Amongthese are the need for a notation for iterating over the elements of any FINITE set ( instead of themore narrow for i : = 1 to n notation ) , the use of the domain of an array as a data type , the need fora simple notation for allowing types of parameters to be themselves parameters ( but in a restrictive fashion ) , and resulting problems with conversion of values from one type to another
