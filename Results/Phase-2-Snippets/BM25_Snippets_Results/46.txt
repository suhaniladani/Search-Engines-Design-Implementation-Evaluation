A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing
A Vector Space Model for AUTOMATIC INDEXING In a document RETRIEVAL , or other pattern matchingenvironment where stored entities ( documents ) are compared with each other or with incoming patterns ( search requests ) , it appears that the best INDEXING ( property ) space is one where each entity lies as far awayfrom the others as possible ; in these circumstances the value of an INDEXING system may be expressibleas a function of the density of the object space ; in particular , RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE may correlate inverselywith space density An approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimumindexing vocabulary for a collection of documents AUTOMATIC information RETRIEVAL , automaticindexing , content analysis , document space Typical EVALUATION results are shown , demonstratingthe usefulness of the model

Theoretical Considerations in Information Retrieval Systems
Theoretical CONSIDERATIONS in Information RETRIEVAL Systems One is self-organizationof the file based on its history and past PERFORMANCE , and the second is a self-generating subsetof the file with a high probability of being relevant For searching strategy , a linear model for an EVALUATION functionof relevancy is developed which rewards the system for retrieving relevant documents and not retrievingthe nonrelevant , and penalizes the system for the escaped relevant documents and false drops Information storage and RETRIEVAL systems are composedof three major components : ( a ) identification of information and tagging it for effective RETRIEVAL , ( b ) searching strategy , how to enter the file to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material , and ( c ) file organization to make access to information efficient
