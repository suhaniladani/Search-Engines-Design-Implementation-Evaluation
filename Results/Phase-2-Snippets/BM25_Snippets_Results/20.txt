Cellular Arrays for the Solution of Graph Problems
Cellular Arrays for the Solution of GRAPH Problems In this paper it is shown that cellulararrays are inherently well suited for the solution of many GRAPH problems For example , the adjacencymatrix of a GRAPH is easily mapped onto an array ; each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array , and typical row and column operations are readily implemented by simple cell logic A major challengein the effective use of cellular arrays for the solution of GRAPH problems is the determination of algorithmsthat exploit the possibilities for parallelism , especially for problems whose solutions appear TO be inherentlyserial These ALGORITHMS exhibit a computation time that inmany cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n , where n is the number of nodes in the GRAPH GRAPH theory , cellular logic-in-memory arrays , parallel processing , special purpose computers , ALGORITHMS for distance and spanning tree problems In particular , several parallelized ALGORITHMS are presented for the solution of certainspanning tree , distance , and path problems , with direct applications TO wire routing , PERT chart analysis , and the analysis of many types of networks Straightforwardcellular implementations of the well-known serial ALGORITHMS for these problems require about nsteps , and noncellular implementations require from n^2 TO n^3 steps
